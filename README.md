# Coursework 1

Welcome to the repository for Coursework 1, focused on Computing in C++.

### Introduction

The solutions for Questions 1-4 are straightforward and are contained within individual files for each question. For Questions 5-8, the solutions are more complex and are split across three files: a main file, a header file, and an implementation file. We utilize the gcc compiler for this coursework.

Prerequisites:
- A C compiler, such as gcc

## Executing the Tests

To run the solution for a specific question, for example Question 7, simply enter `./q7` in the command line.
